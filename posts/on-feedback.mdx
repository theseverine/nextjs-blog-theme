[WIP]

One of the unending debates in the tech world (and elsewhere) is the question of how to give feedback. We often get rather fuzzy advice, or things like the venerable compliment sandwich (praise, critique, praise). But one thing that tends to be underemphasized is the importance of tailoring feedback to individuals.

One starting point I've found useful is base your initial feedback style on the way your feedback target gives feedback to others *when not under significant stress*. (The later part is important, for our feedback usually changes when under stress&mdash;typically, but not always, in the direction of greater bluntness.)

However, this may not actually be the form of feedback this person wants for themselves. In particularly, many neurodivergent people find it easier to communicate in a direct style, but have developed a much softer style in order to fit in at school, work and life in general. (The costs of this, both in terms of loss of message clarity and in terms of the higher cognitive load on neurodivergent people when masking in this manner, are worthy of separate discussion.)

So it's important to build a relationship with them where you can trust them to evaluate how you prefer to give feedback. And that's something that only comes with time.

More to come...
