title: "What are automated tests for anyway?"

I once asked this question to a group of developers as part of a talk, and got some shakes of the head and of course the natural answer "to confirm that the code works as expected." It's the obvious answer, and it is for the most part correct, but it isn't quite the full story, and it doesn't provide much guidance as to what to wrote automated tests for other than "everything."

It's also a subtly misguided answer, because if we knew the code we were writing would never be changed and would never be run in a different environment from the one we were testing it in, would we write automated tests at all? It'd probably be quicker to manually test it. And every developer has, indeed, written many little once-off scripts to solve problems on an ad hoc basis, and has tested these manually rather than using automated tests.

So perhaps a more exact formulation is "to confirm that the code continues to work as expected." And not only is this formulation more exact, but it gives us some guidance on what's most important to test.

To be continued...
