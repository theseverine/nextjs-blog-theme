title: "It Depends (I)"
description: "No, really, there isn't One True Answer"

There has been much debate over recent years over the vexed question "is it better to use story points or not use story points?" [ADD CITATIONS], and all too much of this debate has come with an implicit assumption that there's One True Answer to this question.

This post is just to remind you that there isn't, and that&mdash;as with all interesting sociotechnical questions&mdash;the correct answer to this question is a mixture of "it depends" and "you haven't defined this question clearly enough yet."

Some of the factors involved in determining the answer to the debate would include:
- Organizational structure and communication styles
- What the organization is and where it is in its life (a startup? preparing for IPO? mature? a bank? a non-profit?)
- Financial runway
- Management style at the C-suite level
- The customer base
- Applicable legal regulations
- The experience level (and actual experience) of the developer and management teams
- The personal priorities of the whoever is actually asking the question
