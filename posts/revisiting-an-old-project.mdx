## Performance

Well, this thing wasn't very optimised at all. But sometimes optimisations don't come in the place you expect.

The sequence member base object's constructor method worked like this. I don't remember why I used `Object.defineProperty()` to set it&mdash;and there may have been good reasons for it, but none were in the documentation or ADRs in the repository.
```
    constructor(val: SeqMemberArgument) {
        Object.defineProperty(this, '_val', {
            value: val,
            configurable: false,
            enumerable: true,
            writable: false
        });

        Object.freeze(this._val);
        Object.freeze(this);
    }
```

But, since the tests were very complete, it was easy to rewrite in a more standard manner (correcting the constructor argument along the way) and indeed all the tests passed.
```
    constructor(val: T) {
        this._val = val;

        Object.freeze(this._val);
        Object.freeze(this);
    }
```

Something else less obvious happened too&mdash;the runtime for my performance testing script dropped by _50%_. Yes, 50%. I'd been expecting some small increase, but not this.
