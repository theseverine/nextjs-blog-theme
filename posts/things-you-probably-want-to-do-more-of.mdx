title: Things you probably want to do more of

Here are some of the things I need to remind myself to do more often.

## Stepping away from the computer
- Take a notebook rather than a laptop into meetings, and take notes in it.
- Draw things out on paper or a whiteboard rather than on the computer.
- Stop yourself occasionally, step back and assess things from a greater distance.
- Get up from your desk several times a day to give your brain a different kind of stimulation.

## Ask yourself
- Why you didn't disagree with anything in the article you just read?
- How could I simplify the thing I'm currently working on, and would this simplify the whole or just move the complexity elsewhere?
- How will I measure the success and/or failure of the thing you're working on?
- How could I explain this to someone who doesn't understand it? (This will help you understand it better.)
- Do I actually need to do this?
- Who should I be reaching out to over this? (In my experience, engineers always undercommunicate.)
- Is this a decision where the result is important, or a decision where making a decision is important?

## Reminders
- Leave something easy unfinished at the end of the day to kickstart your next morning.
- Lack of clarity in terminology causes so many bugs and design errors. Clear it up!
- All metrics are proxy metrics for something that can't actually be measured.
- You don't ask 'why?' often enough. Nobody asks 'why?' often enough, myself included.
- [The failure you're dealing with didn't have a single root cause](https://how.complexsystems.fail).
