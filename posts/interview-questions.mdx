So I'm getting ready to do interviews for a senior role at some local organizations, and I'm thinking about interview questions. Not so much about the questions they'll ask me (though I will prepare for those as well), but about the questions I awnt to ask them: so I get a proper idea of how the company actually works under the hood, and&mdash;ultimately&mdash;whether I want to work there.

Some of these are fairly obvious, some are perhaps less obvious.

## Interviews with technical folx

TODO: These are an opportunity to understand 

- What does a deployment look like?
    - What does deployment verification look like?
    - What does a rollback look like?

This will give an indication as to whether the engineering culture is 'throw it over the wall' or 'we understand what is happening in production.' Now, granted, there's other ways to figure this out (my favourite telltale is that advertising for a "devops engineer" means throw it over the wall).

- What does a production incident look like?
    - What is the process after the incident has been resolved?
    - How many recommendations do you typically make?
    - Do you have any incident reports that you make public? (You might want to research this upfront.)

## Both

- Hiring a new senior engineer comes with the opportunity to ask the question "why?" a lot. Are there any areas you'd want me to ask "why?" a lot in, and if so, why?
